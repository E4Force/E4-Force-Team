* `t-photos` contains 2 photos of the team (an official one and one funny photo with all team members)
* `v-photos` contains 6 photos of the vehicle (from every side, from top and bottom)
* `video` contains the video.md file with the link to a video where driving demonstration exists
* `schemes` contains one or several schematic diagrams in form of JPEG, PNG or PDF of the electromechanical components illustrating all the elements (electronic components and motors) used in the vehicle and how they connect to each other.
* `src` contains code of control software for all components which were programmed to participate in the competition
* `models` is for the files for models used by 3D printers, laser cutting machines and CNC machines to produce the vehicle elements. If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.

It may include documentation how to connect to a SBC/SBM and upload files there, datasets, hardware specifications, communication protocols descriptions etc. If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.

## Introduction

Our solution is a very versatile mount in which if we have problems with any of the components there would be no problem in replacing them. This of course if there is a problem in first place. We agreed on making the mount of our robot lego based. Legos are very versatile, and they don’t give much trouble so it was ideal so we could focus more on the more complex parts. We also decided on using a microcontroller more specifically the MOTION 2350 Pro from Cytron Technologies mainly because of how much voltage it could handle (12V) since this would allow us to have more speed. Also it has more than enough ports for the sensors and motors. Our main motor (the one on the back) is a TT Motor (one more speed based) since we wanted more speed than torque because the other model we were using was pretty strong but very slow. We also are using a micro servo to turn the wheels which has been giving us some trouble. It seems that the servo we will be using was wrong on the datasheet since we noticed that the servo motor has a wider range than the one specified in the datasheet found online. The datasheet claimed the servo had a range from 1ms to 2ms with 1.5ms being the center. But when we were testing it we found out it actually had more. It seems that it has around 0.9ms more from both directions, making it instead of 1ms to 2ms, 0.7ms to 2.4ms and  1.5ms being the center. This part is the one that has given us the most trouble. As for sensors we plan on using 2 or 3 distance/color/motion/ambient light sensors (two up front and one down for the track colors) and 2 ultrasonics sensors (one on each side to be able to maintain the robot centered while on). The ultrasonic sensors we will be using are the HC-SR04 sensors. This sensor will make sure the robot does not get too close to the walls by precisely turning the wheels just as much as needed. The color/motion/ambient light sensors we will be using are the APDS9960 sensors and VL53L1X for long distance. These sensors have more than enough reach to be able to turn on time and are also very precise and small so its not hard to easily accommodate them. Also, a white LED light will be used alongside the sensor that will be ubicated underneath so there’s enough illumination to detect colors. These sensors are the ones that will guide our robot.  As for the code were using Micro Phyton as the language of coding. We are programing with the Thonny app. Micro Phyton is not the most complex and is also not so hard to learn and use. The robot is programed to precisely use the sensors, the servo and the TT motor. This will be crucial for our success and were confident it’s going to do the trick. We plan on using a 12V battery to fully utilize the board’s potential, but in case we don’t get it on time we will be using 9V batteries. All the non-lego pieces are mounted using adapters. These adapters are all 3d printed, all of these were made by someone else which will be accredited. Although the servo adapters gave us some problem, this because when the servo didn’t fully fit in the adapter so when it was actioned it dismounted itself.
